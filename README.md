The 2016HBXX beatbox dataset

This repository contrains the Mel Frequency Cesptral Coefficients from the 2016HBXX dataset we used in our submission to ISMIR 2018: "Comparing clustering techniques for beatbox sound classification"

This dataset consists of the mean vectors of 13 static MFCCs extracted from 341 beatbox productions recorded by a single beatboxer. 

To load the dataset, see the companion notebook.
